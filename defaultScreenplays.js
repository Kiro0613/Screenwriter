	"content":["FADE IN:","INT. BARBALOW CAFE - DAY","Patrons chirp at one another and waiters bustle around carrying coffees and pastries. At one of the tables is JAMES, a Matrix-clad thirtysomething with slick-backed hair and a leather coat, pounding away on his laptop.","WAITRESS","(nervous)","Excuse me, sir? Would you like anything?","James turns to her and nods with a smug grin. He continues his typing with one hand.","JAMES","No, thanks. I'm cool. Say, why don't you get yourself a drink, on me? I should have the money in three, two...","James's laptop beeps violently and a cash register noise is heard.","JAMES (cont'd)","And, done! There we go - I've hacked into the mainframe of the Trustworthy Pioneer Bank and transferred twenty million dollars straight from those corporate bigwigs' accounts into mine. It's okay to be impressed, baby.","FADE TO:","EXT. ALLEYWAY - SUNSET","JAMES drives down the street. He parallel parks next to an abandoned warehouse with a sign reading \"WARNING: NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OCCURS HERE. PLEASE LOOK AWAY.\"","James gets out of his car, fedora pulled low over his head. He walks into the alley and meets two other men, BROCKO and SHIVA.","BROCKO","Ya got the goods?","JAMES","\"Do I got the goods?\" Hell yeah, I got the goods. What do you think I am, some square?","James gives finger guns and peers over his sunglasses.","SHIVA","Yeah, whatever. Cough it up then.","James puts down his backpack and pulls out a laptop. He starts pounding away on the keyboard a la 90s hacker movies. A USB stick plugged into the laptop dings and flashes. The others squint suspiciously.","JAMES","Here ya go!","Shutting the laptop, James rips the USB drive out of the laptop and throws it to Shiva, who catches the drive and eyes it.","JAMES (cont'd)","There you go, Daddio."],
