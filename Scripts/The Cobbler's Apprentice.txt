{"content":["FADE IN:","int. cobbler's shop - day","We see a small, cluttered, dimly lit room full of tools, papers, shoes, and a workbench. A thin, old man sporting round glasses and a tan Victorian gentleman's is sanding a shoe on his workbench. He is the COBBLER, hard at work on his craft.","The Cobbler is intensely focused on his work, squinting and moving his arms like magic. He's startled and his focus is broken by a KNOCK at the door.","Opening the door, the Cobbler sees TIBBLES, a small boy dressed in rags. His voice is like a pisstake of Charles Dickens.","TIBBLES","Please sir, I want to make shoes!","The cobbler slams the door.","","ext. london streets - later","Tibbles, heartbroken at his rejection, walks the busy streets of London. There is an excessive stench of feces (though the audience can't tell because this is a film).","Tibbles turns a corner into a dark alley and meets the CROOK, a tall, thin man with a ponytailed skullet, dark clothes, and missing teeth. He brandishes a knife.","CROOK","(smugly)","Well, if it isn't little Tibbles! Did you have any luck with the cobbler, then?","TIBBLES","N-no, sir.","Tibbles shrinks up and looks at his shoes.","CROOK","You know what that means, boy?","The Crook snarls his teeth and lifts his knife.","CROOK","It means we can try again tomorrow.","He lowers the knife and puts on a friendly expression. Haha, I made him look like he was gonna kill Tibbles for cheap drama! I totally lied to the audience."],"classes":[0,0,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,0,1,1,4,3,2,4,2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1]}1540
